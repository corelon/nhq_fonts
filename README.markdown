# Nhq Fonts

This is collection of __programming fonts__ modified with minimal linespacing
as this is settings I prefer to program with.

## Fonts modified

* __Monaco__ (the old one, without ligatures)

## Notes

* Tested mostly on Windows 7, but should work in older Windows or even
  Linux and Mac
* Tested in following applications:
    - VIM & GVIM
    - Visual Studio 2008 & 2010
    - SQL Management Studio
    - JetBrains WebStorm (Should work for all JetBrains IDEs)
    - Komodo IDE
    - Editra
    - Browsers: Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox
    - Shells: Windows CMD, MinGW32
* Monaco is only in regular version (No bold or italics). For best
  result set your text editor enviroment to not use bold or italics,
  because these would be rendered approximatelly.
